#  About Me
I am currently a Post-doctoral Fellow in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, [the University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://www.hku.hk), supervised by Prof. Kaibin Huang. I received the Ph.D. degree in computer and information engineering from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-SZ)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), China, in 2023, under the supervision of Prof. Chuan Huang and the B.Eng. in electronic engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Techonology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China, in 2017.

My research interests include: 
- Semantic Communications
- Massive Machine-type Communications
- Federated Learning
- Edge Intelligence
